# Joey Bae's Digital Portfolio

Welcome to the repository for my digital portfolio. This website showcases my projects, professional experience, technical skills, and background spanning software engineering, data science, AI automation, and graphic design.

The portfolio is built as a highly responsive, modern single-page application using **Next.js**, **React**, and **Tailwind CSS**, and is set up for automatic deployment to **GitHub Pages**.

## ⚙️ Configuration & Setup

### Environment Variables

The contact form uses a Web3Forms access key. To configure it, create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_WEB3FORMS_ACCESS_KEY=your_web3forms_access_key_here
```

### GitHub Pages Settings (`next.config.ts`)

To allow Next.js to export static files and host them properly under GitHub Pages subpaths:

- `output: "export"` (configured for static exports)
- `images.unoptimized: true` (disables Next.js default image optimization, which requires a Node server)
- `basePath: "/joeyb-portfolio"` (prefixes asset links with the repository name)

---

## 💻 Local Development

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JoeyBae93/joeyb-portfolio.git
   cd joeyb-portfolio
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server:**

## 📦 Build & Deployment

### Manual Static Build

To build and export the site locally into a static `./out` folder:

```bash
npm run build
```

### Automated GitHub Pages Deployment

This repository is configured with a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) that automatically builds and deploys the site whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch:

1. Code is checked out and built statically (`npm run build`).
2. The `./out` directory is bundled and uploaded as a GitHub Pages artifact.
3. The bundle is deployed live on GitHub Pages.
